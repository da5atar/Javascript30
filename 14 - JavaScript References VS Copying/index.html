    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team) // outputs ["Mass", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // team is a reference to players so updating one element will change the original array (players)

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice(); // slice method without arguments will return a copy of the original array

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // concatening an empty array with the original array will also return a copy of it

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players] // spread will take every item out of the iterable and puts in in the containing 


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Luke';

    // with Objects
    const person = {
    	name: "Mass Sow",
    	age = 35
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const prince = person;
    prince.number = 5; // updates the original object as prince is a reference

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const better_prince = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 36}); /* using Object.assign method and passing in an empty object, the object we want to copy properties from and fold in the new properties you wish to overwrite */
    console.log(better_prince);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
